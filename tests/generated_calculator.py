Of course! Here is a simple `Calculator` class in Python with the requested methods and docstrings.

This example includes:
1.  A class docstring explaining the purpose of the class.
2.  Method docstrings explaining what each method does, its arguments (`Args`), and what it returns (`Returns`).
3.  Error handling for the `divide` method to prevent division by zero.
4.  An example of how to create an instance of the class and use its methods.

### The `Calculator` Class

```python
class Calculator:
    """
    A simple calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations.

    This class does not store any state. Each method takes numbers
    as arguments and returns the result of the operation.
    """

    def add(self, a, b):
        """
        Adds two numbers together.

        Args:
            a (int or float): The first number.
            b (int or float): The second number.

        Returns:
            int or float: The sum of a and b.
        """
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        """
        Subtracts the second number from the first number.

        Args:
            a (int or float): The number to be subtracted from.
            b (int or float): The number to subtract.

        Returns:
            int or float: The difference between a and b.
        """
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        """
        Multiplies two numbers.

        Args:
            a (int or float): The first number.
            b (int or float): The second number.

        Returns:
            int or float: The product of a and b.
        """
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        """
        Divides the first number by the second number.

        Args:
            a (int or float): The numerator.
            b (int or float): The denominator.

        Returns:
            float: The result of the division.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the denominator (b) is zero.
        """
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        return a / b

# --- Example Usage ---

# 1. Create an instance of the Calculator class
my_calculator = Calculator()

# 2. Use the methods to perform calculations
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

sum_result = my_calculator.add(num1, num2)
difference_result = my_calculator.subtract(num1, num2)
product_result = my_calculator.multiply(num1, num2)
quotient_result = my_calculator.divide(num1, num2)

# 3. Print the results
print(f"Calculator Instantiated.")
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {sum_result}")
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {difference_result}")
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {product_result}")
print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {quotient_result}")

# 4. Example of handling the division by zero error
print("\n--- Testing Division by Zero ---")
try:
    my_calculator.divide(10, 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# You can also view the docstrings using the help() function
print("\n--- Viewing Docstrings ---")
help(Calculator.add)
```

### How to Run the Code

1.  Copy the code and save it in a file named `calculator.py`.
2.  Run it from your terminal: `python calculator.py`

You will see the calculated results and the error handling message printed to the console, followed by the docstring for the `add` method.
